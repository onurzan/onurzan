<h2>Hi there. I'am Onur ZAN.</h2>

<h3>Jr. Frontend Developer / React Developer</h3>

<p>In addition to my sound engineering and musicianship, I have almost two years of experience in Frontend Developer (artistically and logically), 
which I continue to learn by increasing my curiosity and interest day by day. I improve my JavaScript proficiency during Bootcamp and learned how to develop single page applications with React.js and how to use different APIs and packages. Apart from these I became familiar with Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB. I am constantly expanding my skill set. I love to try and learn new things and share with others.</p>
